//! Local semantic code search powered by llama.cpp.
//!
//! νgrεp finds code by meaning, not just keywords. It uses local LLM embeddings
//! to perform semantic similarity search across your codebase.
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! ```bash
//! vgrep init           # Download models
//! vgrep serve          # Start server
//! vgrep watch          # Index and watch for changes
//! vgrep "auth logic"   # Search by meaning
//! ```
